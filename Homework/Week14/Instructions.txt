1) Use edge detection and a queue to write a program to count the number cells in a picture
Here is the high-level algorithm
1. Start from the first pixel in the image. Set current label to 1. Go to (2).

2. If this pixel is a foreground pixel (edge or 255) and it is not already labelled, give it the current label
and add it as the first element in a queue, then go to (3). If it is a background pixel (not edge or 0) or
it was already labelled, then repeat (2) for the next pixel in the image.

3. Pop out an element from the queue, and look at its neighbours (the 8 neighbors around).
If a neighbour is a foreground pixel and is not already labelled, give it the current label
and add it to the queue. Repeat (3) until there are no more elements in the queue.

4. Go to (2) for the next pixel in the image and increment current label by 1.
