1) Take the code of a cannon shooting a ball and edit the code so that the ball
   bounces off the top, bottom, left and right sides of the screen

2) Now instead of using the sides of the screen I want you to use the Wall class we created in class to replace
   the bottom, top, left and right sides of the screen with actual walls. Edit your code so that the ball bounces off these 4 walls.
   Note: you will need to code the hit detection between a circle and a wall. The algorithm was covered in class.

3) In class we talked about how we can detect if a circle (ball) hits the wall, but how can we detect if a rectangle hits the wall?
   Update the code so that the cannon is shooting a square instead of a circle and make the sqaure bounce off the 4 walls you created in part 2
   Hint: Think about an approximation technique.
   Hint: It would be best to make a Square class.
