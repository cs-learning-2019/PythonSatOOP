Using the given starter code answer the following questions.

1) Edit the code so that the cannon can move using WASD. Take a look at Week 1 Complex_user_interactions to review how to do this.

2) Edit the code so that the cannon has a laser targeting system that shows how the ball will move after one bounce

3) Edit the code so that if two balls touch each other they blow up. You can just simply make the balls disappear but removing it from the list of balls.

4) Edit the code so that balls explode (disappear) on the second bounce. The first time the ball hits a wall it will bounce but the second time it hits
   a wall the ball will disappear.
