The HW is same as last week (try question 2 again)

Using the given starter code answer the following questions.

1) Edit the code so that the cannon can move using WASD. Take a look at Week 1 Complex_user_interactions to review how to do this.

2) Edit the code so that the cannon has a laser targeting system that shows how the ball will move after one bounce

3) Edit the code so that if two balls touch each other they blow up. You can just simply make the balls disappear by removing it from the list of balls.

4) Edit the code so that balls explode (disappear) on the second bounce. The first time the ball hits a wall it will bounce but the second time it hits
   a wall the ball will disappear.

For question 2
1) Loop over all walls and find all the point of contacts between the walls and the tanks laser
2) Go through all the POCs and find the one with the minimal distance to the tank
3) Draw a line from the end position of the cannon to the POC
4) find the reflection vector of the laser bouncing off the target wall (the wall with the closest POC)
5) compute the end position of the laser
6) draw a line from the POC to the end position of the laser
