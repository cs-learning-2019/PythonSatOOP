1) Complex user interactions
	- Detecting and handling multiple key presses
	- Hold shift to run

3) Sounds in processing
	- Can we build a class to handle all the sounds?
	- This class should be responsible for loading all of the sounds we will be using and exposing methods to play and stop sounds

4) Collision Detection and Resolution
	- point and circle
	- point and rectangle
	- circle and circle
	- rectangle and rectangle
	- rectangle and circle
	- ball bouncing off a horizontal or vertical wall

This will be useful
There is overlap when a line starts before another line ends
def isOverlapping(a1, b1, a2, b2):
    return max(a1, a2) <= min(b1, b2)
