1) Collision Detection and Resolution
	- point and circle
	- point and rectangle
	- circle and circle
	- rectangle and rectangle
	- rectangle and circle

This will be useful
There is overlap when a line starts before another line ends
def isOverlapping(a1, b1, a2, b2):
    return max(a1, a2) <= min(b1, b2)

2) Vectors
	- What are vectors?
		https://mathinsight.org/vector_introduction and https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html
	- sin and cos and cosine law
		https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-cosine-law.html
	- What are unit vectors and how do we compute them? Why are they useful (hint: we want to decouple the magnitude from direction)?
	- Code a ball being shoot out from a cannon but by using a speed and unit direction vector. This involves computing a unit direction vector.
	- Explain how balls can bounch off horizontal and vertical walls
	- Dot product and projections (prove dot product formula first then prove projection)

		https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1064465/what-is-the-difference-between-the-dot-product-and-the-scalar-projection
	- How to define a 2D wall. We need to cover slope, slope vector, unit normal vector
		- How to compute slope and slope vector
		- How to compute the unit normal vector (hint [a, b] --> [b, -a])
		- Use dot product to prove that our method of finding the unit normal vector is correct
		- Create a Wall class which has a starting and ending point along with a width. The constructor should initialize the slope and unit normal vectors.
	- How to find the distance from a point to a line. Start with horizontal and vertical lines then try slanted lines.
		- Extend this to explain how to detect when a ball hits the wall
	- Ball bouncing off slanted walls?
