1) Vectors
	- Quick review of dot product and projection

	- Code a ball being shoot out from a cannon but by using a speed and a direction vector (should be a unit vector).

	- Explain how balls can bounch off horizontal and vertical walls (Students will code this in the homework for the first question)

	- How to define a 2D wall. We need to cover slope, slope vector, unit normal vector
		- How to compute slope vector (basically a direction vector for the line)
		- How to compute the unit normal vector (hint [a, b] --> [b, -a])
		- Use dot product to prove that our method of finding the unit normal vector is correct
		- Create a Wall class which has a starting and ending point along with a width. The constructor should initialize the slope and unit normal vectors.

	- How to find the distance from a point to a line. Start with horizontal and vertical lines then try slanted lines.
		- Extend this to explain how to detect when a ball hits the wall

2) Ball bouncing off slanted walls?
